    <string name="bigres3">Great! You probably want to conquer Everest</string>
    <string name="birdRes1">Are you inclined to believe that once the situation has deteriorated, it will never get back to normal? Maybe you should try to think along these lines: If it\'s that bad, it can\'t get any worse. Remember, there is no rain that will not end, and no night that will not be followed by dawn</string>
    <string name="birdRes2">You believe that life is a mixture of good and bad; and that you shouldn\'t struggle with this reality. You accept adversity calmly and let things take their course without undue worry or stress. This outlook allows you to weather the waves of adversity safely and not let them carry you away</string>
    <string name="birdRes3">You don\'t waste time worrying and being indecisive, even when a crisis develops. If the situation becomes too bad, you feel that it is better to stop this unprofitable business in time and look for another way to your goal than to get bogged down in no one\'s grief. This approach means that everything seems to happen naturally and in your own way</string>
    <string name="birdRes4">You don\'t know what pressure is. For you, every crisis is an opportunity. You could be compared to Napoleon, who said: "…Impossible is not a French word." But be careful not to let your boundless confidence take over you. The line between fearlessness and recklessness is very thin</string>

    <string name="cats2Res1">When describing a cat\'s favorite pastime, you realize that all creatures have the right to behave as they please. This suggests that you are easy to get along with people and quickly find common ground with anyone. People almost always feel comfortable around you. However, because of this ease of communication, you can sometimes give the impression of a person superficial and indifferent to others</string>
    <string name="cats2Res2">The features of the feline character that caught your attention are qualities that are also in you. Your true self is a kaleidoscope of constantly changing pictures. Those who love you, you seem an eternal and endless mystery, which each time they are happy to unravel anew. But those who don\'t have time to solve riddles may prefer not to get involved with a man who is more trouble than he is worth</string>
    <string name="cats2Res3">It seems to you that the world was created so that you could use and enjoy it at your own pleasure. Such a view can manifest itself in the form of calm self-confidence or simply excessive egocentrism</string>
    <string name="cats2Res4">There is a sense of loneliness in your response. You prefer to express yourself in the emotional and social spheres of life, as a result of which you give the impression of a sympathetic and sincere person who shows sincere concern for people. At the same time, this same quality makes you overly sensitive</string>
    <string name="catsRes1">You don\'t know cats very well</string>
    <string name="catsRes2">If you have a cat, then get to know it better</string>

    <string name="controlRes2">You have average communication control. You are sincere, but reserved in your emotional manifestations. You should be more considerate in your behavior with the people around you</string>
    <string name="controlRes3">You have high communication control. You can easily fit into any role, react flexibly to changes in the situation, and even be able to anticipate the impression you make on others</string>

    <string name="courtRes1">You manage to keep your composure and composure. But sometimes, as an ardent fighter for justice, you can also explode if the situation requires it. The combination of equanimity and passion helps in solving any problem that confronts you</string>
    <string name="courtRes2">You are always calm, even if everyone is panicking. Others are aware of this and treat you with respect, asking for help in difficult cases. You get the feeling that where you are, there are problems. But all these situations are not stressful for you, because inside you are absolutely indifferent to everything that happens</string>
    <string name="courtRes3">When faced with difficulties, you begin to reflect on what was done wrong, look for the reasons for what is happening, and do not solve the problem. To feel more confident, you try to maintain relationships with those who are successful in this life and, in your opinion, have no problems</string>
    <string name="courtRes4">You like to help others, but this participation leads to the conclusion that in any situation you have to rely only on yourself. This is how you act in a difficult case: you try to find the right way out on your own and deal with a limited number of people</string>
    <string name="eggRes1">The snake symbolizes wisdom, education and wealth. Therefore, dreams of such a future often do not come true</string>
    <string name="eggRes2">The turtle is a symbol of health and longevity. The turtles who choose the egg are especially worried about the children</string>
    <string name="eggRes3">Choosing a dinosaur egg is a testament to the dream of seeing children as unique individuals. Of course, they will have their own mistakes, but the parents hope that these mistakes will at least be original</string>
    <string name="eggRes4">The choice of a chicken egg indicates that a person does not have crazy plans related to children. It is enough that they are there</string>
    <string name="enRes1">You won\'t be able to talk to anyone. You may die..</string>

    <string name="confRes2">your self-confidence is somewhat unstable. If you are supported by many years of experience, you can assume that everything is in order. But strangers and new tasks annoy you more than is objectively necessary. In such cases, you easily lose confidence in your abilities. Then, depending on your mood, you either lock yourself in or become overconfident</string>
    <string name="confRes3">you clearly lack positive self-esteem. You probably aren\'t used to trusting others. You torment yourself with reproaches and memories, while depriving yourself of the joy of life. Try to take the time to analyze the cause of self-doubt.

    <string name= "pictureRes1">Your friendly and positive personality makes a great impression on almost everyone you meet. Your only concern should be that people may not take you seriously at first</string>
    <string name= "pictureRes2">You are the type of person who likes to find out the temperament of another person before starting to communicate. People can sense your indecision, and it can affect their reaction. With your careful approach, you will never step on anyone\'s foot, but you may end up living on someone else\'s terms</string>
    <string name="pictureRes3">Half of the people perceive you as a completely normal person, but for the other half you look a little strange. At the first meeting, it seems that you live in your own rhythm and are a person that some may call eccentric. You don\'t attach much importance to what others may think or feel. Good or bad, that\'s your secret</string>
    <string name="pictureRes4">When you first meet someone, you give the impression of being somewhat nervous and overly active.

    <string name= "standupRes3">Oh yes, you clearly have a future in humor</string>
    <string name="tastyRes1">In dealing with people, you show honesty and openness. Your sincerity is akin to the innocent enthusiasm of a child. However, you should keep in mind that not everyone is ready to respond to you with the same sincerity and frankness</string>
    <string name= "tastyRes2">The world is full of people, and you wouldn\'t mind meeting every one of them. You have a gift for seeing the best in people. However, your desire to taste a little bit of everything can be interpreted as an unwillingness to develop a relationship with any one person</string>
    <string name= "tastyRes3">If you are lucky enough to meet someone with similar interests, tastes and aspirations, you will be quite satisfied with this communication. However, it may very well be that by limiting your communication to one type of relationship, you are shutting out a whole treasure trove of equally beautiful experiences</string>

    <string name= "tempRes1">Phlegmatic\n calm and quiet. For them, first of all, calmness and a positive emotional background in the team, among friends or in the family are important. Such people are excellent at handling large amounts of information, as well as the task of classifying and distributing them. They often act as intermediaries in conflicts. They are not used to showing their emotions and feelings, but at the same time they try to delve as deeply as possible into the essence of other people. On the other hand, phlegmatics are often selfish, easily judge others, resist change, and try to participate little in any activities. A phlegmatic person can be described as an "observer" </string>
    <string name= "tempRes2">Melancholic and thoughtful. Such people approach the solution of problems thoroughly and very carefully. Therefore, they are able to find answers to those questions that would confuse others. Melancholics are by nature deeply feeling and thinking natures, who often see the negative aspects of life rather than the positive ones. They are self-reliant, independent, and fully committed to what they do. Very often they are perfectionists – they set themselves such heights that are extremely difficult to achieve. These are people who are capable of truly deep love and devotion. Melancholics are more likely to suffer from depression and apathy. A melancholic can be described as a "thinker" </string>
    <string name= "tempRes3">Choleric\pambitic and power-seeking. They are leaders by nature: they always strive for control, always try to do everything perfectly. They are focused primarily on their goals. Weakly sensitive to the emotions and experiences of other people. For them, it is important that the job is done, and done perfectly. Such people are impulsive and active. Irritability and intemperance-this is about them. Relying on logic, analytics, their own opinion and their own position are their resources. But along with these qualities, such people have the greatest difficulties with controlling their anger and lack of patience. They always want facts first, not emotions. A choleric person can be described as a "doer" </string>
    <string name= "tempRes4">Sanguine\nThe tireless seeker, doer, and restless. Sanguine people are the soul of the company. They always try to be the center of attention, to amuse others and to have fun themselves. The most hated thing for them is monotonous and routine work. This they try to avoid at all costs. They are cheerful, fervent, always on the move and searching. But even these optimists have their drawbacks: they do not always finish the job they started. Sanguine people are more likely to become victims of various types of addiction: tobacco, alcohol, drugs, gambling. They\'re also often late for anything. A sanguine person can be described as a "speaker" </string>

    <string name="zolRes2">In real life, not much happens at the wave of a magic wand, and turning into a princess is a fairy tale. The person who chose this scene is not a practical and responsible person, who in his heart hopes that his problems can be solved in the same incredible way</string>
